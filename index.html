<h3>The world's most livable city</h3>
<p>The "Global Liveability Index 2023" of the British Economist Intelligence Unit, has awarded Vienna first place as the most liveable city in the world.

The Danish capital of Copenhagen has come in second place, followed by the Australian cities of Melbourne and Sydney and the Canadian city of Vancouver. Zurich, which ranked third last year, dropped to sixth place. Geneva comes in seventh place behind Zurich together with the Canadian city of Calgary. Damascus, Tripoli, Lagos, and Kyiv are currently among the least attractive cities in the world according to the ranking.</p>
<p>Mayor Michael Ludwig:
</br>
</br>
"The frequent top rankings prove that Vienna is a well-functioning city, based on sound policy decisions, that is ready for the future. Everyone in our city benefits from the high quality of life, the stability, and the reliable infrastructure. These achievements are not least to the credit of everyone who works for this city every day." 
</br></br>
173 cities worldwide have been compared in the ranking. The index is based on 30 factors in the following five categories: stability, healthcare, education, culture and environment, and infrastructure.</p>
